# self_driving_RCcar_project
 ## I. How to open and run the project
### Install library in Arduino IDE
   * In the desciption of each file, you will find "All libraries needed for the RC car project" or "These are Arduino files for each function" or "Valuable Observations and Notes"
   * Download all the libraries with the description of "All libraries needed for the RC car project" and save those files in your prefered directory.
   * Open Arduino IDE, under Sketch, drag your mouse pointer to the "Include library" and then click "Add .zip library". Choose all the libaries to add.
   * It should show up something like "Library named.... successfully added" indicating successful library addition.

### *** Important! Read this carefully!:
1. After install all the libraries in Arduino IDE in the previous step, follow these steps to properly install IMU library with no errors for implementing IMU:
   * Under Document tab (For Window), you shall see the Arduino folder that contains all the libraries that you just installed from the previous step.
## II. Problems need improvement
